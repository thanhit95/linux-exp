# SOME MISCELLANEOUS USEFUL COMMANDS


Which package provides the command I want to use?

Fedora:

```shell
dnf provides <command_name>

#
# dnf provides chsh

# Output example:
# util-linux-user-2.38.1-4.fc38.x86_64 : util-linux utilities based on libuser
# Repo        : fedora
# Matched from:
# Filename    : /usr/bin/chsh
```
