### DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT AND THEME

Theme:

- Theme directory location:
  - Global: `/usr/share/themes`
  - Local: `~/.themes`

- Icon directory location:
  - Global: `/usr/share/icons`
  - Local: `~/.icons`

For GNOME: Execute app "Extensions" and config as my taste.

- Extension "Dash to Dock": Decrease size, make it transparent.

For XFCE:

To change font weight of theme, especial Thunar file manager, we need to edit or create file: `~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css`.

```text
* { font-weight: 500; }
.thunar * { font-weight: 500 }
XfdesktopIconView.view { font-weight: 500 }
```

### X11 COMPATIBILITY IN WAYLAND

A lot of apps that prefer running in X11 in the old days, so if they run in Wayland then some errors would occur.

To make X11 compatible in Wayland in system-wide settings:

- Edit `/etc/profile`
- Add `export GDK_BACKEND=x11`

If you use `zsh`, make sure `/etc/zsh/zprofile` gets source from `/etc/profile`.

Or, if you only want to make changes in user-wide settings:

- Edit `~/.profile`
- Add `export GDK_BACKEND=x11`

A note for the shell, make sure that:

- bash: `.bash_profile` gets source from `~/.profile`
- zsh: `.zprofile` gets source from `~/.profile`

&nbsp;

### DESKTOP WALLPAPERS

App: Variety.

Homepage: <https://peterlevi.com/variety>.

**Notes for Manjaro GNOME:**

To run Variety correctly, we run it in terminal to see all output messages.

Before installing Variety, we must install its dependencies:

```shell
sudo pacman -S python-pip
```

Variety might not display its icon on topbar, to fix this:

- Make sure the GNOME extension "AppIndicator" was turned on.
- Run Variety with `GDK_BACKEND=x11`:
  - `GDK_BACKEND=x11 variety`, or
  - `env GDK_BACKEND=x11 variety`
