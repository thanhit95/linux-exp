# SETUP: ZSH AND OH MY ZSH

## WHAT IS ZSH

> ZSH, also called the Z shell, is an extended version of the Bourne Shell (sh), with plenty of new features, and support for plugins and themes. Since itâ€™s based on the same shell as Bash, ZSH has many of the same features, and switching over is a breeze.

## INSTALLATION

### Step 01. Install zsh

Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt install zsh
```

Manjaro:

```shell
sudo pacman -S zsh
```

After installing, we might make zsh the default shell:

```shell
sudo chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Note: Restart (or logout) to take effects.
